# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the Multi-Track Performance DNA Analyzer to use a pre-trained machine learning model instead of directly depending on raw racing datasets. The current application processes CSV files from multiple track folders (barber, COTA, Road America, Sebring, Sonoma, VIR) to generate driver performance profiles and DNA signatures. The redesigned system will train a model using these existing datasets, validate it to ensure ≥95% accuracy and reliability, and then integrate it into the application to process new user-provided data without requiring the original datasets.

## Glossary

- **DNA Analyzer**: The Multi-Track Performance DNA Analyzer application that creates driver performance fingerprints
- **Training System**: The component responsible for training and validating the machine learning model using historical track data
- **Inference System**: The component that loads the pre-trained model and processes new user data
- **Model Artifact**: The serialized trained model file(s) including weights, scaler, and metadata
- **Performance DNA**: A unique performance fingerprint consisting of metrics like speed_vs_consistency_ratio, track_adaptability, consistency_index, and performance_variance
- **Driver Archetype**: Classification of drivers into categories (Speed Demons, Consistency Masters, Track Specialists, Balanced Racers)
- **Validation Threshold**: The minimum 95% accuracy and reliability requirement for model acceptance
- **User Data**: New racing data provided by users in CSV format for analysis
- **Feature Engineering Pipeline**: The process of extracting and transforming raw racing data into model-ready features

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Model Training Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to train a machine learning model using existing track datasets, so that the application can operate independently of raw data files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Training System is executed, THE Training System SHALL load all CSV files from the six track directories (barber, COTA, Road America, Sebring, Sonoma, VIR)

2. WHEN raw track data is loaded, THE Training System SHALL apply the same feature engineering pipeline used in the current PerformanceDNAAnalyzer to extract driver performance metrics

3. WHEN features are extracted, THE Training System SHALL create training labels for driver archetypes, performance predictions, and DNA signature components

4. WHEN training data is prepared, THE Training System SHALL split the data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets using stratified sampling

5. WHEN data splitting is complete, THE Training System SHALL train multiple model architectures (neural network, gradient boosting, ensemble) to predict driver DNA signatures and archetypes

### Requirement 2: Model Validation and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to validate that the trained model achieves at least 95% accuracy and reliability, so that I can confidently deploy it to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model training completes, THE Training System SHALL evaluate each model on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics

2. WHEN evaluation metrics are calculated, THE Training System SHALL compute the overall reliability score as the weighted average of accuracy (40%), precision (30%), recall (20%), and F1-score (10%)

3. IF the overall reliability score is less than 95%, THEN THE Training System SHALL reject the model and log detailed failure reasons

4. WHEN a model achieves ≥95% reliability, THE Training System SHALL perform cross-validation with 5 folds to verify consistency

5. WHEN cross-validation completes, THE Training System SHALL generate a validation report containing all metrics, confusion matrices, and performance breakdowns by driver archetype

6. WHEN validation passes, THE Training System SHALL serialize the model artifacts including model weights, feature scaler, label encoders, and metadata to disk

### Requirement 3: Model Artifact Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the trained model and its dependencies to be properly packaged and versioned, so that the application can reliably load and use them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a model passes validation, THE Training System SHALL save the model artifacts to a designated models directory with version numbering

2. WHEN saving model artifacts, THE Training System SHALL include a metadata file containing model version, training date, validation metrics, feature names, and model architecture details

3. WHEN model artifacts are saved, THE Training System SHALL create a model registry file that tracks all trained models with their performance metrics

5. WHEN the application starts, THE Inference System SHALL load the latest validated model from the models directory

### Requirement 4: Inference System Integration

**User Story:** As an application developer, I want to replace the direct data processing pipeline with model inference, so that the app no longer requires raw datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN model loading completes, THE Inference System SHALL verify model integrity by checking metadata and performing a test inference

3. IF model loading fails, THEN THE Inference System SHALL raise an error with detailed diagnostic information and prevent application startup

4. WHEN the application receives new user data, THE Inference System SHALL validate the data format and required columns match the training data schema

5. WHEN user data is validated, THE Inference System SHALL apply the same feature engineering transformations used during training

6. WHEN features are extracted from user data, THE Inference System SHALL pass them through the loaded model to generate predictions for driver DNA signatures and archetypes

7. WHEN predictions are generated, THE Inference System SHALL format the output to match the existing driver profile structure used by the application

### Requirement 5: User Data Processing

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to upload my own racing data and receive DNA analysis results, so that I can analyze new drivers without needing the original datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides new racing data, THE DNA Analyzer SHALL accept CSV files in the same format as the original track data

2. WHEN CSV files are uploaded, THE DNA Analyzer SHALL validate that required columns (NUMBER, LAP_TIME, S1, S2, S3, KPH, track) are present

3. IF required columns are missing AND the missing columns allow partial analysis, THEN THE DNA Analyzer SHALL display a clear error message indicating which columns are missing and SHALL offer the user the option to proceed with limited data at their own risk of unreliable results

4. IF required columns are missing AND the missing columns prevent any meaningful analysis, THEN THE DNA Analyzer SHALL display an error message and SHALL prevent further processing

5. WHEN user data is valid OR the user accepts to proceed with limited data, THE Inference System SHALL process the data through the feature engineering pipeline

6. WHEN features are extracted, THE Inference System SHALL generate driver DNA profiles using the pre-trained model
