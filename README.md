## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Driver DNA Profiling**
- **Speed vs Consistency Analysis**: Identifies whether drivers prioritize raw speed or consistent lap times
- **Track Adaptability Scoring**: Measures how well drivers adapt to different track layouts
- **Performance Variance Tracking**: Analyzes consistency across different racing conditions
- **Sector-Specific Strengths**: Identifies which parts of tracks drivers excel at

### 2. **Multi-Track Analysis**
- **Cross-Track Performance Comparison**: Compare driver performance across all 6 tracks
- **Track Difficulty Classification**: Automatically categorizes tracks as technical, high-speed, or balanced
- **Weather Impact Assessment**: Analyzes how weather conditions affect different drivers
- **Sector Time Breakdown**: Detailed analysis of S1, S2, S3 performance patterns

### 3. **Driver Archetypes**
The system identifies four main driver archetypes:

#### üèéÔ∏è **Speed Demons**
- High raw speed but variable consistency
- Excel in qualifying but may struggle in race conditions
- **Training Focus**: Consistency and tire management

#### üéØ **Consistency Masters** 
- Exceptional lap-to-lap consistency
- Strong race pace but may lack qualifying speed
- **Training Focus**: Peak performance and aggressive techniques

#### üèÅ **Track Specialists**
- Excel at specific track types but struggle with adaptability
- Strong at either technical or high-speed circuits
- **Training Focus**: Versatility and quick adaptation

#### ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced Racers**
- Well-rounded performance across all metrics
- Consistent performers across different track types
- **Training Focus**: Developing specialized strengths

### 4. **Interactive Visualizations**
- **DNA Radar Charts**: Visual representation of driver characteristics
- **Performance Heatmaps**: Track-by-track performance comparison
- **Cluster Analysis**: Groups drivers by similar performance patterns
- **Individual Driver Reports**: Detailed analysis for each driver

## üìä Data Sources

The analyzer processes multiple data types:
- **Sector Times**: S1, S2, S3 performance data
- **Lap Times**: Complete lap time analysis with consistency metrics
- **Speed Data**: Top speeds and average speeds per sector
- **Weather Data**: Temperature, humidity, wind conditions
- **Race Results**: Final positions and race-specific performance

### üìÅ Note on Large Telemetry Files

Due to GitHub's file size limitations (2GB per file), the large telemetry CSV files are not included in this repository. These files can be obtained from the official race data sources and manually added to the corresponding track folders:

**Required Telemetry Files:**
- `COTA/Race 1/R1_cota_telemetry_data.csv`
- `COTA/Race 2/R2_cota_telemetry_data.csv`
- `Road America/Race 1/R1_road_america_telemetry_data.csv`
- `Road America/Race 2/R2_road_america_telemetry_data.csv`
- `Sebring/Race 2/sebring_telemetry_R2.csv`
- `Sonoma/Race 1/sonoma_telemetry_R1.csv`
- `Sonoma/Race 2/sonoma_telemetry_R2.csv`
- `VIR/Race 1/R1_vir_telemetry_data.csv`
- `VIR/Race 2/R2_vir_telemetry_data.csv`
- `barber/R1_barber_telemetry_data.csv`
- `barber/R2_barber_telemetry_data.csv`

The application will function with the included lap time, sector time, and race results data. Full telemetry analysis features require these additional files to be placed in their respective directories.
