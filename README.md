> An AI-powered racing performance analysis tool that creates unique "performance fingerprints" for drivers across multiple tracks, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and driving characteristics.

## üéØ Project Overview

The **Multi-Track Performance DNA Analyzer** revolutionizes driver performance analysis by creating comprehensive "DNA profiles" that reveal individual racing characteristics. Using advanced machine learning and statistical analysis, it processes multi-track racing data to identify driver archetypes, track-specific strengths, and personalized training opportunities.

**Key Innovation**: Unlike traditional lap time analysis, this tool creates holistic performance fingerprints that capture speed, consistency, adaptability, and sector-specific expertise across different track types.

### üìÅ Note on Large Telemetry Files

Due to GitHub's file size limitations (2GB per file), the large telemetry CSV files are not included in this repository. These files can be obtained from the official race data sources and manually added to the corresponding track folders:

**Required Telemetry Files:**
- `COTA/Race 1/R1_cota_telemetry_data.csv`
- `COTA/Race 2/R2_cota_telemetry_data.csv`
- `Road America/Race 1/R1_road_america_telemetry_data.csv`
- `Road America/Race 2/R2_road_america_telemetry_data.csv`
- `Sebring/Race 2/sebring_telemetry_R2.csv`
- `Sonoma/Race 1/sonoma_telemetry_R1.csv`
- `Sonoma/Race 2/sonoma_telemetry_R2.csv`
- `VIR/Race 1/R1_vir_telemetry_data.csv`
- `VIR/Race 2/R2_vir_telemetry_data.csv`
- `barber/R1_barber_telemetry_data.csv`
- `barber/R2_barber_telemetry_data.csv`

The application will function with the included lap time, sector time, and race results data. Full telemetry analysis features require these additional files to be placed in their respective directories.
